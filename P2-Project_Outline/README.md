### What I'll Have to Learn
By coding this project, we plan to learn the Javascript language as well as the Vue.js framework to build the front-end of our application. We will also gain an understanding of the principles of RESTful programming and isomorphic architecture in building this single-page application (SPA). We will not only become proficient in the use of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) internally to manage data, but also in the use of external APIs such as the Google Maps API and payment processing APIs. 
The group will continue to build upon our previous learning by using MySQL as our database, Bootstrap to style our web pages, and C# to allow all the parts of our application to work together. Although we have experience in these skills, this will be our first opportunity to create a working, functional application from the ground up.
